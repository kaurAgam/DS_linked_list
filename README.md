# DS_linked_list
Types of _LINKED LISTS_:
- Singly Linked List – each node of the linked list points only to its next node. 
- Circular Linked List –  the last node points back to the head of the linked list. 
- Doubly Linked List – each node of the linked list holds two pointers, one point to the next node and the other points to the previous node.
### Various Operations that can be performed on Linked lists
1. search for a value
2. traversal (traverse the linked list)
3. insert a node in beginning of linked list
4. insert a node at end of linked list
5. insert a node after a specified value in linked list
6. delete a node from beginning of linked list
7. delete a node from end of linked list
8. delete a node (of specified value) from linked list
